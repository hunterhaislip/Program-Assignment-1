For this program, I have created a easy to use menu function. To compile the project load it in Visual Studio and begin to run it. 
When loaded, the project will present the menu and ask to select an item (Use capital letters to select). When an item is selected,
there more menu options that are choices for that item. To simply go back hit a character that is not one of the menu items and 
hit enter. Here you may now select another item or simply quit the program. All of the numbers such as the weight and lifespan are
made up and may be changed to represent real applications in the world.
